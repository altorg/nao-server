Instructions for ssh access with chroot.

In this config, sshd performs the chroot, and dgamelaunch runs un-privileged
inside the chroot.

- This does not necesarily reflect how NAO is configured currently.
- This config should coexist with telnet access (whereby telnetd launches dgl
  as root, and dgl does the chroot and drops privilege), but this is untested.

1. Build dgl and nethack binaries, and init-chroot according to the README.
2. Create a symlink with a well-known name to the timestamped chroot:
     cd /opt/nethack ; ln -s nao-chroot-<date>-<time> chroot

3. Edit os/sshd.txt and set the ChrootDirectory to the full path of the link:

ChrootDirectory /opt/nethack/chroot

4. Append this to the END of your /etc/ssh/sshd_config and reload sshd.
5. Add user 'nethack', and set home to /dgldir and shell to /dgamelaunch 
6. Lock the password as we don't need it:
     passwd -l nethack

7. Edit /etc/pam.d/sshd and put the following 2 lines before the "@include
   common-auth" line:

# Allow nethack user via ssh without password
auth            sufficient      pam_succeed_if.so  user = nethack

8. mount a new devpts instance in the chroot, and create a symlink for ptmx:
     mkdir -p /opt/nethack/chroot/dev/pts
     mount devpts /opt/nethack/chroot/dev/pts -t devpts -o \
         newinstance,ptmxmode=666
     cd /opt/nethack/chroot/dev
     ln -s pts/ptmx .

9. Add this mount to /etc/fstab so it comes back on reboot, as follows:

devpts  /opt/nethack/chroot/dev/pts  devpts  newinstance,ptmxmode=666  0  0

10. move dgamelaunch.conf into chroot, but keep path the same, so dgl can be
    launched from inside or outside the chroot:
      mkdir -p /opt/nethack/chroot/opt/nethack
      cd /opt/nethack
      mv dgamelaunch.conf chroot/opt/nethack
      ln -s chroot/opt/nethack/dgamelaunch.conf .

11. Edit /etc/passwd and set the UID:GID for nethack to be 5:60 so it has
    equivalence to the games user. These numbers need to match the shed_uid
    and shed_gid in dgamelaunch.conf, and also have permission to write
    anywhere the game needs to write (xlogfile, save, nethack rc files, etc).
    These things are already configred by init-chroot.sh to be owned by games.
    It should look like this:

nethack:x:5:60:NetHack Player:/dgldir:/dgamelaunch

12. Make any necessary/desired edits to dgamelaunch.conf, and test.
